##  360 videos

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="HELhXDG-Mck" %}

Our 360° videos from Galactic Centre simulations put you at the
position of Sgr A*, the super-massive black hole, from where you can
look in any direction.  The animations show unprecedented views of
stars orbiting you, the viewer, their winds colliding from an
uncluttered vantage point, and clumps of material tidally stretching
as they inspiral around you.  These videos are best viewed with VR
goggles; otherwise the YouTube app on a handheld smartphone or tablet
allows you to observe in any direction.

displays the cold gas in red and yellow.  Two simulations are shown:
the first with stellar winds only, the second with an additional
outburst from Sgr A*.

[This newer version](https://youtu.be/wBxW2_B9_Is)
displays both the cold (in red and yellow) and the
hot, X-ray emitting gas (in blue and cyan).

## Galactic Center VR

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="wAbiFvT1IeM" %}

The Galactic Center VR application allows you fly around the
few-light-year region around Sagittarius A*, seeing the orbiting
stars, their stellar winds, and the X-rays they emit. Or scale down
the simulation so everything fits within your VR play area, allowing
you to walk around the center of our galaxy. View the whole simulation
in stellar winds only, X-rays only, or both, as well as check out the
contribution from just one stellar wind at a time.
