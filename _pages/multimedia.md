##  360 videos

Our 360° videos from Galactic Centre simulations put you at the
position of Sgr A*, the super-massive black hole, from where you can
look in any direction.  The animations show unprecedented views of
stars orbiting you, the viewer, their winds colliding from an
uncluttered vantage point, and clumps of material tidally stretching
as they inspiral around you.  These videos are best viewed with VR
goggles; otherwise a handheld smartphone or tablet allows you to
observe in any direction.

This version displays the cold gas in red and yellow.  Two
simulations are shown: the first with stellar winds only, the second
with an additional outburst from Sgr A*.
