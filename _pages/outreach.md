## 360 videos

Our 360° videos from Galactic Centre simulations put you at the
position of Sgr A*, the super-massive black hole, from where you can
look in any direction.  The animations show unprecedented views of
stars orbiting you, the viewer, their winds colliding from an
uncluttered vantage point, and clumps of material tidally stretching
as they inspiral around you.  These videos are best viewed with VR
goggles; otherwise the YouTube app on a handheld smartphone or tablet
allows you to observe in any direction.

displays the cold gas in red and yellow.  Two simulations are shown:
the first with stellar winds only, the second with an additional
outburst from Sgr A*.

[This newer version](https://youtu.be/wBxW2_B9_Is)
displays both the cold (in red and yellow) and the
hot, X-ray emitting gas (in blue and cyan).

## Galactic Center VR

The [Galactic Center VR](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1240350/Galactic_Center_VR/)
application allows you fly around the few-light-year region around
Sagittarius A*, seeing the orbiting stars, their stellar winds, and
the X-rays they emit. Or scale down the simulation so everything fits
within your VR play area, allowing you to walk around the center of
our galaxy. View the whole simulation in stellar winds only, X-rays
only, or both, as well as check out the contribution from just one
stellar wind at a time.
