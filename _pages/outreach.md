## video game

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="LJEkrP08RtE" %}

**Protoplanet Express** is a video game in which you can visit different protoplanetary systems.  Each system visualisation is based on computer simulations developed by professional astronomers.

A beta version of the game for different operating systems can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfWOr-7_aDPBvLBNjyfATgq3zNEBcgyxdTZB3892Vm7Mjpktg/viewform).  We would be grateful if you could answer a few questions about your experience after trying out the game.


## 360 videos

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="HELhXDG-Mck" %}

Our 360° videos from Galactic Centre simulations put you at the
position of Sgr A*, the super-massive black hole, from where you can
look in any direction.  The animations show unprecedented views of
stars orbiting you, the viewer, their winds colliding from an
uncluttered vantage point, and clumps of material tidally stretching
as they inspiral around you.  These videos are best viewed with VR
goggles; otherwise the YouTube app on a handheld smartphone or tablet
allows you to observe in any direction.

[This version](https://youtu.be/YKzxmeABbkU)
displays the cold gas in red and yellow.  Two simulations are shown:
the first with stellar winds only, the second with an additional
outburst from Sgr A*.

[This newer version](https://youtu.be/wBxW2_B9_Is)
displays both the cold (in red and yellow) and the
hot, X-ray emitting gas (in blue and cyan).

## Galactic Center VR

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="wAbiFvT1IeM" %}

The [Galactic Center VR](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1240350/Galactic_Center_VR/)
application allows you fly around the few-light-year region around
Sagittarius A*, seeing the orbiting stars, their stellar winds, and
the X-rays they emit. Or scale down the simulation so everything fits
within your VR play area, allowing you to walk around the center of
our galaxy. View the whole simulation in stellar winds only, X-rays
only, or both, as well as check out the contribution from just one
stellar wind at a time.
